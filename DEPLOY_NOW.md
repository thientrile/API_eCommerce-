# 🚀 DEPLOY TO RAILWAY - Quick Start

## ✅ Your Code is Ready!
Your latest changes have been pushed to GitHub and your application is configured for Railway deployment.

## 🔄 Next Steps (5 minutes to deploy):

### 1. MongoDB Atlas Setup (2 minutes)
1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/) 
2. Create FREE cluster → Create database user → Add IP `0.0.0.0/0`
3. Copy connection string: `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database?retryWrites=true&w=majority`

### 2. Deploy to Railway (2 minutes)
1. Go to [Railway](https://railway.app/)
2. Click "Start a New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select repository: `thientrile/API_eCommerce-`
4. Railway automatically detects Node.js and starts building

### 3. Set Environment Variables (1 minute)
In Railway dashboard → Variables tab, add:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

### 4. Add Redis Service
1. Railway dashboard → "New Service" → "Database" → "Redis"
2. Copy Redis URL and add as environment variable:
```bash
REDIS_URL=redis://default:password@hostname:port
```

## 🎉 You're Done!
